This repo describes efforts to pipeline explicitly a neuroimaging data workflow that involves T1 MRI, CT,
and iEEG data (ECoG, or SEEG). For ECoG data, we do not explicitly have a process outlined, but these are significantly easier since grids can
be easily interpolated. See `Fieldtrip Toolbox`_.

We build and keep up-to-date a number of Dockerfiles to run various workflows:

- acpcdetect:

Note: For FSL, we use a 3rd party docker image.

Setup and Installation
----------------------

See `INSTALLATION GUIDE <https://github.com/ncsl/seek/blob/master/doc/installation.rst>`_ for full instructions. SEEK uses the Snakemake_
workflow management system to create different workflows. We chose this because
it is easy to run individual workflows, as well as an entire workflow from the command line.
The full repository is set up similar to the `cookiecutter` Snakemake file: `cookiecutter gh:snakemake-workflows/cookiecutter-snakemake-workflow`.

The workflows start from ``dicom`` files for the T1 MRI image and CT image with the implanted electrodes.
The snakemake workflows then automate the naming and computations to get to anatomically labeled electrodes
that also can be fed into a `visualization engine <https://github.com/cronelab/ReconstructionVisualizer>`_.

The recommended installation is via Docker_. See here for instructions on running workflows in the container are shown here below:

Data Organization
-----------------

We use BIDS. See https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit/wiki/The-BIDS-folder-hierarchy

Before data is converted to BIDS in ``seek/pipeline/01-prep`` pipeline,
then ``sourcedata/`` should contain a semi-structured format of the neuroimaging data that will
be put through the workflow.

**sourcedata/**

.. code-block::

   /{subject}/
       - premri/*.dcm
       - posmri/*.dcm
       - postct/*.dcm

Running workflows using Docker and Snakemake
--------------------------------------------
To run snakemake workflows using Docker, we have implemented various ``Makefile`` recipes.
First, you need to change directory to the correct workflow and then run snakemake with some
arguments to bind directories to the singularity container. For example

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --cores 1 --use-singularity --singularity-args "--bind ~/hdd/epilepsy_bids/,~/Documents/seek/";

where, you can alter the cores used, and also bind various directories.
See ``Makefile`` for more details on the following recipes:

* snakemake-all
* recon
* prep-localization
* coregistration
* prep-viz

``You will need to alter the bind paths to your specific BIDS root directory and SEEK repository directory``.

Creating persistent volumes in Docker
-------------------------------------

If one wants to make a persistent data volume that reflects changes in the Docker container running Snakemake workflows, 
then one can just make a ``data/`` directory inside this repository. Then add in sourcedata. This
directory serves as the BIDS root of the workflows.
