INSTALLATION GUIDE
==================

To install the SEEK pipeline, one must install the necessary python runtimes, as well as the necessary 3rd party 
softwares. 

The best way to do so is via a Docker installation.

Docker Installation
-------------------

To run the SEEK pipeline in Docker, first follow instructions to install `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`_.

**NOTE: You will need approximately at least 8-9 GB free disc space to run the Docker container.**

To setup the container in your system:

.. code-block::

   # build the composition in `docker-compose.yml`
   docker-compose up --build

   # run the container
   docker-compose up 


Now if you type in ``docker container ls``\ , you should see the corresponding container.

.. code-block::

   # turn recipe to image
   docker build <image_container_name>

   # turn image to containeer
   docker run -v $PWD/Data:/data -it -e bids_root=/data -e derivatives_output_dir=/data/derivatives --rm neuroimg_pipeline_reconstruction bash


Running Individual Workflows on Docker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reconstruction Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setup the sourcedata directory as follows:

.. code-block::

   sourcedata/{subject}/
                       - premri/*.dcm
                       - posmri/*.dcm
                       - postct/*.dcm


Edit the ``seek/pipeline/config/localconfig.yml`` file to include a list of 
subject ids that you want to analyze.

Then run the following commands (assuming you built the container w/ Docker already):


#. 
   Run reconstruction container:

   ..

      docker-compose run reconstruction /bin/bash


#. 
   Prep the data

   ..

      snakemake --snakefile ./pipeline/01-prep/Snakefile --cores 2


#. 
   Perform reconstruction

   ..

      snakemake --snakefile ./pipeline/02-reconstruction/Snakefile --cores 2


#. 
   Perform coregistration

   ..

      snakemake --snakefile ./pipeline/03-coregistration/Snakefile --cores 2

Manual Installation
-------------------

Python Installations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are a couple of tools that you need to install in your system before everything is working. You ar recommended to use a Linux based OS. 
Follow links and tutorials on each respective tool to install. Preferably this is done via Docker, or Singularity, but if not, then:

Anaconda and Python3.6+ :


* Conda (https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)
* 
  This is mainly necessary to run img_pipe (ECoG localization with Chang-Lab repo), snakemake, and any Python wrapper code

  i. 
     conda env create -f environment.yml --name=seek
     source activate seek
     conda install sphinx sphinx-gallery sphinx_bootstrap_theme numpydoc black pytest pytest-cov coverage codespell pydocstyle
     pip install coverage-badge anybadge
     # dev versions of mne-python, mne-bids
     pip install --upgrade --no-deps https://api.github.com/repos/mne-tools/mne-python/zipball/master
     pip install --upgrade https://api.github.com/repos/mne-tools/mne-bids/zipball/master

  ii. Conda env

     # create environment
     conda create -n seek
     conda activate seek

     # optionally separate install
     conda config --add channels bioconda
     conda config --add channels conda-forge
     conda install numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-learn scikit-image pandas seaborn nibabel mne snakemake mne-bids flask
     conda install pytest black check-manifest pytest-cov pydocstyle

     # check if installation worked
     cd neuroimg/pipeline/reconstruction/
     snakemake -n    

Pip and setup.py install

.. code-block::

   # run installation via setup.py
   make inplace-all

   # install testing functionality
   make install-tests



Pipeline Installations (3rd Party Modules to Install)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


#. Octave

Runs open-source. This runs various scripts for converting output files to object files for rendering visualizations.
Follow: https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/#install

.. code-block::

   brew install octave



#. 
   Gawk
    Runs command line tools.
    https://brewinstall.org/Install-gawk-on-Mac-with-Brew/

#. 
   Blender
    https://www.blender.org/download/Blender2.81/blender-2.81-linux-glibc217-x86_64.tar.bz2/

#. 
   Reconstruction


   * Freesurfer (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/DownloadAndInstall)
   * This step is necessary to generate a parcellation and surface reconstruction of the patient's brain. The general requirements is just a 
     Linux, or OSX computer with enough RAM. Currently, this repo is designed to work with FreeSurfer.

#. 
   Coregistration


   * FSL Flirt (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation/)
   * This step is necessary to map different imaging sessions together. Specifically, for this pipeline, we need it to map CT images to T1 MRI
   * 
     Note that as of 2019, installation still requires Python2, which should come in any Linux distribution.

     .. code-block::

          python2 <run_installer>

#. 
   Utility


   * MRTrix3 (https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/linux_install.html)

#. 
   SPM 


   * SPM install (preferably 12): https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/

#. 
   Contact-Localization Software (FieldTripToolbox, Img_Pipe, MATLAB)


   * FieldTripToolbox (http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/download/)
   * Img_Pipe from the Chang-Lab at UCSF will come as a submodule in this git repo. This heavily handles ECoG data only.

#. 
   ACPC Auto Detection (V2):


   * https://www.nitrc.org/projects/art/

#. 
   (Optional) Cloud Reconstruction (MRICLOUD):


   * MRICloud (cloud based soln; just send images here) (https://mricloud.org/)
   * the nice thing is that this usually works even when FS fails (e.g. the T1 MRI image isn't good enough quality, or there is a major lesion, etc.).


#. (Optional) Nonlinear Registration NDREG:

   * NDReg (https://github.com/neurodata/ndreg)
